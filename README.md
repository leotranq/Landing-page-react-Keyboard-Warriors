This is a Landing page Made betwenn two people, it is made to practice our abilities with react.js HTML and CSS to practice the basics of a webpage and adding animation to it. We use a "Matrix" theme that we thought that is a cool thing to do because of the raining code. 
Also as a theme we focus on describinng a "coding" company called "The keyboard Warriors" that we desigh and created a content just to show design capabilities.
As well we got some easter eggs hidden in the webpage. "it can be funny"
##### please install the web package by writing in the console the next line:

$ npm install
``

#Now you can start coding.

##In order to have a preview open a port 3000 on the console by writing the next line:
- $ npm run start`

This is Just a landing page, it content url links that will take you to a real one.
